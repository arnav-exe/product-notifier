# TODO
 - RETRIES + EXPONENTIAL BACKOFF WILL HAVE TO BE A FUNCTION DECORATOR OR SMTN GLOBAL - DO NOT IMPLEMENT THIS PER DATASOURCE
 - PASS LOGGER TO EACH DATASOURCE INSTANTIATION, FOR GRANULAR, PER-DATASOURCE LOGGING. FORMAT SHOUDL LOOKE LIKE THIS:
 "{timestamp} [{error_severity} - {data_source}]: {log_message}"
 CAN POTENTIALLY DEFINE THIS IN THE FORMATTER


 - I THINK THE 'parse()' FUNCTION FROM EACH SOURCE IS ALSO SUPPOSED TO MAKE RAW RESPONSE CONFORM TO INTERNAL REPRESENTATION - THINK THROUGH AND AMEND IF NECESSARY



# FLOW:
 1. for each product:
    1. for each identifier inside a product:
        1. if we have a matching data source for that particular identiifer, run 'fetch_product()' which will return data in Product obj format
        1. check in stock and sale keys against user specification
        1. if any condition is met, fire appropriate ntfy



# SOURCES TO ADD:
